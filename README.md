Contour Representations Computation  

This MATLAB package is a collection of scripts allowing to generate figures in the paper [1]. This paper addresses the problem of the detection and estimation of the modes of a multicomponent signal using the reassignment framework. More precisely, we propose a new algorithm to estimate the ridges representing the time-frequency (TF) signatures of the modes based on the local orientation of the reassignment vector (RV), and use them to define the so- called “basins of attraction” enabling modes’ retrieval. Compared with previous approaches, this new technique not only enables reconstruction of AM/FM modes but also Dirac impulses, which is of great interest in many practical situations. Numerical ex- periments conducted with both synthetic and real data illustrate the effectiveness of the technique.
